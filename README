This is smack-util-0.1, or thereabouts.

Smack will run without any of this, but you will most
likely want most of this.

etc-init.d-smack

This is the init script for Smack. It invokes smackcipso
and smackload (below) to initialize your Smack access rules
and any CIPSO bindings that you want to assign. It goes in
/etc/init.d. For Fedora Core 7 that would be:

   # cp etc-init.d-smack /etc/init.d/smack
   # chmod 755 /etc/init.d/smack
   # ln -s ../init.d/smack /etc/rc5.d/S01smack

busybox-1.7.2.patch

This is an early attempt to put Smack funtionality into busybox.
So far it's limited to enhancements to ls, ps, stat, and id and
new applets newsmack, smackcipso, smackload, and smackenabled.
The base source for busybox-1.7.2 is not included.

coreutils-6.9.patch

This adds Smack label reporting to ls.
The base source for coreutils-6.9 is not included.

openssh-4.5p1.patch

This adds Smack label setting to sshd. It is not a good
implementation, it is a hack. Not all configuration options
are going to work, but this will vary depending on your setup.
The base source for openssh-4.5p1 is not included.

smackcipso.c

The program that correctly formats data for writing to /smack/cipso.
It reads cipso mappings from standard input in the form:

   label level [category]...

smackload.c

The program that correctly formats data for writing to /smack/load.
It reads access rules from standard input in the form:

   subject-label object-label [RrWwXxAa-]...

smackrecvmsg.c

A handy function that acts like recvmsg() but that passes back
the Smack label on the message, assuming all required setup has
been done. The sole contents of libsmack.a so far.

Makefile

Should be obvious, but it's not very sophisticated and doesn't
comply to and "standard" for application package Makefiles.
